                <p>Dear Tiya,</p>
                <p>
                    I am truly sorry for hurting your feelings. I realize the
                    impact of my actions and I regret it, I want to make amends.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In the brief time we've bonded has been truly enlightening,
                    and the last thing I desire is to witness your sorrow.
                    Please find it in your heart to forgive me.
                </p>
                <p>Let's talk and find a way to fix the wounds between us.</p>
                <p>With sincere apologies,</p>
                <p>Halkano</p>
